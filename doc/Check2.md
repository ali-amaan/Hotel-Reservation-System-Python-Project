# Hotel Reservations Project

## Checkpoint2

## Current properties

Currently the basic login function with the GUI has been coded alongside the display of the calendar. Not all features have been implemented yet.


## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? yes. Basic login system works and the calendar is being displayed.
 - How is the program executed? currently the execution is not possible smoothly and completely because the implementation is not completed.

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far? Altogether it has taken me more than 40 hours.
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan? Yes. I have pushed back the plan a bit. Now I aim to get the full and final implementation ready by 25th of April. I had to do this because of other simultaneous severe courses load, some of which will end very soon.

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems? Minor everyday bugs have been a nuisance but no major problem yet.
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan? Some minor changes in the class definitons and schedule have been done but no major changes were made. Also, have used the 'csv' python library to store and retrieve user data from .csv format files.
