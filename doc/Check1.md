# Hotel Reservations Project

## Checkpoint1

## Current properties

Currently the class definitions have been coded and implemented in the three seperate files uploaded as per their definition in the project plan.


## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? no
 - How is the program executed? currently the execution is not possible because the implementation is not completed.

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far? Altogether it has taken me more than 20 hours.
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan? Yes. I have pushed back the plan a bit. Now I aim to get the basic implementation text base full and final implementation ready by 10th of April. And then, the GUI by the checkpoint 2. I had to do this because of other simultaneous severe courses load, some of which will end very soon.

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems? Minor everyday bugs have been a nuisance but no major problem yet.
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan? Some minor changes in the class definitons and schedule have been done but no major changes were made
